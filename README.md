# Temperature-based-fan-speed-controller
This system is used to control the cooling system automatically based on the room temperature. The project is designed to detect the temperature of the room and send that information to the Arduino board.  Then the Arduino board executes the contrast of current temperature and set temperature based on the inbuilt program of the Arduino.  The outcome obtained from the operation is given through the o/p port of an Arduino board to the LCD display of related data.  The generated pulses from the board which is further fed to the driver circuit to get the preferred output to the fan.
